    "text": "Principal functions reading data into R\n\nread.table, read.csv (tabular data)\nreadLines (text file)\nload (read in saved workspaces)\nsource (for reading in R code files)\n\n\n\n\nread.table() is one of the most commonly used functions for reading data. The help file is definitely worth reading in its entirety.\nThe read.table() function has a few important arguments:\n\nfile, the name of a file, or a connection\nheader, logical indicating if the file has a header line\nsep, a string indicating how the columns are separated\ncolClasses, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset\nnrows, the number of rows in the dataset. By default read.table() reads an entire file.\ncomment.char, a character string indicating the comment character. This defaults to “#”.\nskip, the number of lines to skip from the beginning\nstringsAsFactors, should character variables be coded as factors? This defaults to TRUE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nReading larger datasets with R\nread.table() automatically estimates various parameters to store data. If you provide these this significantly speeds up the reading of large data sets.\n\nSet comment.char = \"\" if there are no commented lines in your file.\nUse the colClasses argument. Specifying this option instead of using the default can make ‘read.table’ run MUCH faster, often twice as fast. In order to use this option, you have to know the class of each column in your data frame. If all of the columns are “numeric”, for example, then you can just set colClasses = \"numeric\".\nSet nrows. This doesn’t make R run faster but it helps with memory usage. A mild overestimate is okay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# use default parameters, missing parameters are estimated\ndata <- read.table(file = \"data/my_data.txt\") \n\n# assign parameters\ndata <- read.table(file = \"data/my_data.txt\", \n                   comment.char = \"\", \n                   header = TRUE,\n                   colClasses = c(rep(\"numeric\",4), \"factor\")\n                   )"
